# Hey there! üëã I'm Belyse Intwaza

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm so glad you stumbled upon my portfolio. Let me tell you a bit about myself and this journey I've been on.

## My Story

You know that feeling when you solve a puzzle and everything just clicks? That's exactly how I felt when I wrote my first line of code back in 2021. What started as curiosity during the AkiraChix CodeHive program has blossomed into a genuine passion for creating solutions that make people's lives easier.

I'm currently a Software Engineer Level 2 at Antara Health, where I've had the incredible opportunity to grow from an intern to someone who leads projects and mentors others. It's been quite the ride, and I'm loving every minute of it!

## What I'm About

I'm not just about writing code (though I do love a good debugging session with a cup of coffee ‚òï). I'm about:

- **Building bridges** between complex technical challenges and real human needs
- **Taking initiative** when I see gaps that need filling (my teammates know I'm always ready to jump in!)
- **Learning continuously** - the tech world moves fast, and I love keeping up
- **Collaborating** - some of my best work happens when bouncing ideas off brilliant teammates

## üõ†My Toolkit

Here's what I love working with:

**Frontend Magic **
- React (my go-to for bringing ideas to life)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (because who doesn't love some type safety?)
- HTML/CSS (yes, I can center a div )
- Tailwind CSS (makes everything look pretty without the fuss)

**Backend Wizardry **
- Node.js (JavaScript everywhere!)
- Python & Django (for when I need that robust backend)
- REST APIs & GraphQL (connecting all the dots)

**The Cool Stuff **
- Git (version control is life)
- Jest (testing keeps me sane)
- Airtable & Zapier (automation FTW)
- Datadog (because monitoring matters)

## What Makes Me Tick

**Problem-Solving Enthusiast**: Give me a tricky bug or a complex user flow, and I'll dive in headfirst. I love understanding the 'why' before jumping to the 'how'.

**Team Player**: I'm that person who's always ready to help with code reviews, pair programming, or just brainstorming solutions over lunch.

**Initiative Taker**: See a gap? I'm probably already thinking about how to fill it. My teammates have learned to expect me to volunteer for the "challenging" tasks.

**Continuous Learner**: Whether it's a new framework, a design pattern, or understanding user needs better, I'm always curious about what's next.

## Things I'm Proud Of

- **Reduced manual work by 45%** for clinical staff through automation (because who likes repetitive tasks?)
- **Went from intern to Engineering Level 2** in just a few years (growth mindset pays off!)
- **Built IoT solutions** that help farmers optimize water usage by 30% (tech for good!)
- **Mentored teammates** and helped unblock development bottlenecks (teamwork makes the dream work)

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not coding, you might find me:
- Exploring new coffee shops in Kigali 
- Brainstorming ways tech can solve everyday problems
- Connecting with other developers (the tech community is amazing!)
- Planning my next project (I always have at least three ideas brewing)

## Let's Connect!

I love meeting new people and talking about everything from code to coffee to crazy project ideas. Here's where you can find me:

- **GitHub**: [github.com/intwaza](https://github.com/intwaza) (where the magic happens)
- **Email**: [iintwazabelyse@gmail.com](mailto:iintwazabelyse@gmail.com) (I actually check this!)
- **Twitter**: [@IntwazaB](https://twitter.com/IntwazaB) (for tech thoughts and random musings)
- **Portfolio**: [Live Portfolio](https://belyse-intwaza-portfolio.netlify.app/) (see my work in action!)

## What's Next?

I'm always looking for exciting opportunities to:
- Build products that make a real difference
- Collaborate with amazing teams
- Learn new technologies and approaches
- Solve problems that matter

Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project, need help with a technical challenge, or just want to chat about the latest in tech, I'd love to hear from you!

## A Little Thank You

If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to get to know me a bit better. The developer community has been incredible to me, and I'm always eager to pay it forward.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner, every professional was once an amateur, and every icon was once an unknown. Keep building, keep learning, and keep being awesome!
